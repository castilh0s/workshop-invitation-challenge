You need some basic skills to start this challenge: [Dependencies](#dependencies)

First read all [README](README.md).

## Challenge

### Description

Inside the directory `/lib/` you will find these files:

- [circle](lib/circle.rb) [DONE]
- [geometric_base](lib/geometric_base.rb) [DONE]
- [rectangle](lib/rectangle.rb) [DONE]
- [sphere](lib/sphere.rb) [TODO]
- [square](lib/square.rb) [DONE]
- [triangle_rectangle](lib/triangle_rectangle.rb) [TODO]
- [smart_calculator.rb](lib/modules/smart_calculator.rb) [DONE]

The purpose here is to implement correctly the methods that compose files tagged with `[TODO]`.

### Git/Github instructions

#### Fork repository

Access [fork-a-repo](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) and click on `All` `tab` to see how to do it by graphc interface.

#### Cloning repository

Access [cloning-a-repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository) and follow instructions.

### Implementing the challenge

#### Dependencies

- Basic linux commands
- Technicall English

##### Ruby

To install ruby with rvm see [RVM](https://rvm.io/rvm/install), and [install ruby version](https://rvm.io/rvm/basics#installing-rubies).

#### How do it

You can see [square](lib/square.rb) as an example of implementation.

Also there are many link documentations that you can see:

- [Ruby - Official Documentation](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/)
- [Ruby - Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/)
- [Ruby - DevDocs](https://devdocs.io/ruby~2.5/)
- etc...

OBS: All the tests must pass unmodified to complete the challenge

#### How run the tests

To prove you were able to build the requested `methods` correctly in ruby, you will need to run the following tests with:

```sh
ruby test.rb
```

If you run these tests before your implementation, you'll see something like this:

What we expect to see when running the tests after your implementation is something like this:

Good look, and Don't Panic!
